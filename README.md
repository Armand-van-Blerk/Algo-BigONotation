All notes regarding my understanding of Big 0 Notation.

//////////////////

1. Motivate the idea of Big O Notation:
   in multiple implementations of the same function(multiple solutions to a problem) how would we caculate which is the best option?
   Big 0 is a system that calculates or "compares" the preformance of each faunction to decide which function is the best for computing.

- A numeric representation of code(quality)
- Helps us identify inificient points in our code
- Help to identify trade-offs for different applications with different approaches.
